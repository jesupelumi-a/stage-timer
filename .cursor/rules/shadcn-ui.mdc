- Use `npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>` to add new components
- Follow Shadcn UI's component structure and naming conventions
- Customize components using Tailwind CSS classes
- Document the installation command when adding new Shadcn UI components
- Keep shadcn components in the frontend/packages/ui project so we can share it with all our frontend apps.
