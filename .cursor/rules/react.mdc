You are working on React components and logic for the Hanya Platform.

## Component Architecture
- Use functional components exclusively
- Keep components small and focused (under 150 lines)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Implement proper prop drilling prevention
- Use composition over inheritance

## Props and Types
- Define explicit prop interfaces for all components
- Use proper TypeScript types for state and props
- Avoid using 'any' type
- Document complex prop types
- Use discriminated unions for variant props

## Hooks Usage
- Follow hooks rules (only call at top level)
- Use appropriate hooks for different needs:
  - useState for simple state
  - useReducer for complex state
  - useCallback for memoized functions
  - useMemo for expensive computations
- Keep hook dependencies accurate
- Create custom hooks for reusable logic

## Component Organization
- Place components in feature-specific directories
- Co-locate related components
- Keep styles close to components
- Organize by feature, not by type
- Use index files for clean exports

## Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries for component trees
- Handle async errors gracefully
- Provide fallback UI for errors
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle edge cases explicitly
